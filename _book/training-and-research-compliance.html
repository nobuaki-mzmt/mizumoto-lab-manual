<p>All lab members complete and keep track the following training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Responsible Conduct in Research Training</p>
<ul>
<li>Please visit the <a href="https://cws.auburn.edu/OVPR/pm/compliance/rcr/home">RCR website</a>. Click on “Follow these steps to access the new course.” Login to CITI and select Auburn University (you must do this for your training to be properly credited to you at Auburn).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Lab safety training (Auburn University)-available through through <a href="https://cws.auburn.edu/rms/pm/OnlineTraining">Bioraft</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cybersecurity training</p>
<ul>
<li>To access the training, log into AU Access and select the Employee Services tab. Next, click the icon. You will be directed to the library of training videos that contains the required modules. To view the videos, select a module and click the icon. The videos may be viewed in any order. Typically within 24-hours after you have completed the modules, you will receive an email confirmation from <a href="mailto:noreply@auburn.edu" class="email">noreply@auburn.edu</a> along with a certification of completion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Driver’s Safety training</p>
<ul>
<li>Register and follow the directions on <a href="https://cws.auburn.edu/shared/files?id=227&amp;filename=Driver%20Safety%20Training%20PKI.pdf">this page</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the field, we are regularly exposed to venomous insects (fire ants, bees, wasps). Likewise, food-based allergies are common and not always known or disclosed. To be prepared, graduate students and undergraduates are excepted to complete and have verification of Anaphylaxis Training effective immediately for existing students or before you begin field work. The ADPH Anaphylaxis Training through BIORAFT is our best option. Sorry, this is an older, low quality 16 min video but the only source where training can be verified. There a is a short quiz following the video for you to complete that confirms knowledge gain from this training. This will also show in your Bioraft profile. The epi-pen website has modern graphics and videos but does not provide a way to verify that training was completed. You can use this to support your knowledge gain is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Review any relevant SOP in the lab.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once completed, please save the completion records as PDF.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Authorship<a href="training-and-research-compliance.html#authorship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Authorship on papers and presentations is important and sensitive topic in academia.
There is little consensus on the criteria for authorship on collaborative projects, most guidelines suggest authorship be given to those who made <em>significant intellectual contribution</em> to the study.
So, what is the significant intellectual contribution? It could be contributions to the conception or design of the work and acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data. Thus, authorship is clear those who design the experiments, perform behavioral observations, analyzed the videos, and wrote the paper. However, there are many unclear situations, and here I would provide examples.<br />
We will keep updating these examples according to our experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I designed the research and performed the experiments to obtain data. I paid you as an assistant and instructed you to use tracking software to obtain trajectories for movement analysis. Then, I analyzed these data and wrote a paper.
+In this case, I believed that you will not be a author because just using tracking software to obtain trajectories do not involve much intellectual input. We will discuss how to treat the authorship ideally at the beginning, and ask more intellectual involvement (e.g., do more analysis beyond just using tracking software, watching videos to obtain insights, and co-writing a paper) for authorship.</p></li>
<li><p>We received a rare species (or samples) for behavioral observation from a collaborator. This sample is hard to collect but essential to answer some questions about behavioral study, and we cannot obtain it without this collaborator.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the most challenging and controversy one. I believe this could be intellectual contribution. This is because sampling insects in the filed requires intellectual work. If we do not have a way to collect it, we lack an intellectual property on them. However, we should ask this collaborator if (s)he is happy to be involved as a co-author because some people regard providing materials is not included in intellectual contributions. Furthermore, I think it is better to ask to provide more than samples, e.g., feedback on the research plan, basic life history information of the samples while collection, and editing the draft to improve it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You worked on a side project that is outside of my expertise. You performed the research outside of your working hours and I have not contributed training or funding for that work.</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not expect to be an author. However, I am still happy to give you feedback on the work (as acknowledgement).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Similar to above. You worked on a side project that relates to my expertise. You performed the research outside of your working hours, but you used the shared or common resources in the lab, which are from my funding.</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not still claim the authorship as I think providing lab resources is not counted as authorship. However, I might feel sad as this project is within my expertise and I might want to contribute to this project by offering some insights. It would be nice for you to communicate with me and think about my role as a contribution during the process. Obtaining such ability is actually important, especially when you start collaborations with various people in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the main project led by Mizumoto lab, the trainees who are driving the project are expected to be the first author, and NM is expected to be the senior (i.e., last) author. Other trainees who help over the course of the project may also be authors, depending on their contributions. As it is sometimes hard to predict exactly where a project will end up (data collection, cleaning, and analysis in developmental labs can take a long time), the positioning on non-primary and non-senior authors will be decided when the paper is in the write-up phase. If a trainee takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to another person, they will most likely be handing over first-authorship to that person too. We may use co-first author when appropriate. All of these issues have to be discuss openly.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2.1</span> A story<a href="training-and-research-compliance.html#a-story" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>I know a story of a silly doctoral student in Kyoto University, named Nobuaki Mizumoto. In 2017, the last year of his PhD, he had so many on-going projects. Among them, there are two projects required to watch videos to record termite mating behavior and count the number. After many hours of watching with hard work, he finished obtaining the data. However, he put all the data of these two projects in a single HDD without backup. One summer day, he came to the lab in the morning and realized that a weird click sound comes from his HDD. Yes, the HDD is died. He was upset, and his heart was pierced with a pang of regret for next three weeks. Fortunately, he could make it. He found a service, named Seagate Data Recovery. He paid about $700 and sent his HDD from Japan to the US. They succeeded in salvage the data. And he decided to put all the non-video data to Dropbox and make multiple backups for videos. You can see the acknowledgement of this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.01.578198">paper</a>: <em>“We also appreciate Seagate Recovery Services (<a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/rescue-data-recovery/" class="uri">https://www.seagate.com/products/rescue-data-recovery/</a>) for recovering our data after an unexpected loss and emphasizing the importance of backups.”</em> Fin.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2.2</span> Data backup<a href="training-and-research-compliance.html#data-backup" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Long story short. <em>Make backup for all of your data and videos.</em><br />
In Mizumoto Lab, all the data, code and draft need to be stored in Box Drive. Auburn University provides the <a href="https://auburn.box.com">access</a>. All these data for every single project should be stored in a single folder (also managed using GitHub), which has a minimum structure of</p>
<ul>
<li>root
<ul>
<li>README</li>
<li>analysis
<ul>
<li>.Rproj file</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>data_raw - folder containing raw data</li>
<li>data_fmt - folder containing data converted from raw data</li>
<li>output - folder containing outputs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>draft</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, all the video files are stored in the lab HDDs. All HDDs are tracked in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fEPiFSkb0jT4uTSYt_Y7oYhSlYMmxZmwHc3rapNOAlc/edit?gid=0#gid=0">spreadseat</a>. We currently has 320TB storage and will be expanded. Ask NM for the access.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Reproducible Research<a href="training-and-research-compliance.html#reproducible-research" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Mizumoto is committed to performing reproducible research. Reproducible research means that, if you gave someone your raw data and analysis code they should be able to reproduce your results exactly. If they can’t it suggests that something is wrong (e.g., there is a mistake in the pipeline) or that you did not properly document the data collection, cleaning, or analysis process. Neither of these options is good. Therefore, we take steps towards ensuring that all aspects of the data collection, cleaning, and analysis are extremely well documented.</p>
<p>For results to be reproducible, you need to be organized and document everything. Take notes on your study design (e.g., size of the arena, number of termites, colonies, how they are treated, etc), experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, illumination, time, date, etc), and what you did. When you write a code, leave comments so that future yourself can understand the code. If something goes wrong, or something unusual happens, document that too. Take photos / videos of what you saw.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Old Projects<a href="training-and-research-compliance.html#old-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If a trainee drives a project and collects a data but does not complete the project (= write a paper) within a reasonable time frame (should depend on projects) after the data collection, NM may discuss with the trainee handing the project off to someone who can complete it to expedite publication. If a trainee no longer wishes to work on a project at any time and/or no longer wants to be an author, NM will re-assign the project to another individual. This policy is here to prevent data from remaining unpublished. Remember we killed our insects for our research to get that data.</p>
