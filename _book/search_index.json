GRA represent an appointment of 0.33 FTEs. No graduate student can work more than 0.5 FTE and they typically are not less than 0.25 FTE. This means a student is responsible for working at least 13.2 hours weekly on research outside of their thesis/dissertation on work that contributes directly to the performance of research in the lab. This includes assisting your lab mates with their work. These hours are not monitored currently because we have a culture of collegiality where students willingly assist one another as needed with field or lab projects. Only when a student is clearly not contributing to the work of the lab will these hours be monitored or enforced. Students are responsible for paying all the various university and health fees. Base pay rates for students on GRA fellowships are set departmentally. MS degree: $23,000 + 3.80% Fringe benefit PhD degree: $25,000 + 3.80% Fringe benefit GTA fellowships of $1000 per semester are available occasionally through the department. These funds are provided to a student account for the additional work required for a GTA. These GTA fellowships must be approved by the department Chair. Productivity incentives Ultimately, the job of researchers is writing. Therefore, graduate students are encouraged to write their work as they progress through their degree program. So we have productivity incentives as follows: Submit a paper to a refereed journal (the first submission for each paper) first (co-fisrt) or corresponding author: $500 per year added to stipend co-authors: $250 one-time award in student account Accepted at exceptional journals (incentive = 1 in the list). $500 one-time award in student account Note that the manuscript co-authored with Dr. Mizumoto is eligible for incentives. Grant I am still figureing out what opporunity exists for students. Will be added to here. If you achieve something noteworthy, please let me know. I may add that to this policy. Undergraduates Undergraduate students pay rates usually begin at $10 per hour. 4.2 Lab meetings and seminars Daily journal club Mizumoto lab has a daily journal club (TBD, 11:30am-12:00pm?). No preparation will be required other than downloading pdf or printing it. We will read one paper together within 30 min. If you find a paper you want to read, just add it to the list (link). Department seminar Department of Entomology &amp; Plant Pathology has a department seminar during semesters, and you are expected to attend it. Ask a question even if it is very different from our field (mostly they are!). Thinking about what to ask for a question is a most effective way to attend seminars. Lab meeting I am thinking of a biweekly lab meeting to present the progress. Discuss this later. Shared Lab Meeting We have shared lab meeting between Clint Lab (Entomology), Mizumoto Lab (Entomology), and Smith Lab (Biology) on collective behavior in social insects. This is a monthly meeting on the first week of Friday. Annual evaluation meeting All trainees will have one-to-one annual evaluation with PI (NM), where PI provides an evaluation with a trainee, and trainee provides an evaluation with PI. I will provide a one-page sheet for the evaluation. 4.3 PI Availability NM is usually writing in the morning (8:30-10:30 am) if there are no other schedule. Except for this time, NM is available for any kinds of meeting with lab members until 5:30pm. All other meetings are in my outlook calender (nzm0095@auburn.edu), and thus, you can freely add meeting schedules with me on the vacant spots. You do not need to ask me to add it if you schedule it by 6am of the day. If lab members send me an email, I try to reply it on the same day or next day if it is within usual working day. If you do not receive response within 48 hours, feel free to send me a reminder. Whenever you request feedback for your proposal or manuscript, please put a deadline. It will help both of us. And feel free to bug me close to the deadlines (even on the day off) – I won’t be offended by reminders. Instead, I will appreciate them! For any tasks with a hard deadline, I always use a virtual deadline with one week before. This is for safety. I may get sick or have accident. Please remember this and behave in the same way. But in emergency, do not hesitate to ask me to do something in a last second. 4.4 Presentations Learning to present your research is important. Very few people will read your papers carefully (sad, but true) but you can reach a lot of people at conference talks and posters. Also, if you plan on staying in academia, getting a post-doc position and getting a faculty position both significantly depend on your ability to present your data. Even if you want to leave academia, presentations are likely to be an important part of your job. Additionally, every time you present your work, you are representing not just yourself but the entire lab. It is therefore highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs (within or outside of Auburn), at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), consider to have a practice presentation to the lab as early as you can. Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation. Templates for posters will be available, and you can use those as much or as little as you’d like. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. Other than that, go with your own style. NM is also happy to share slides from some of his talks if you would like to use a similar style. You’ll get a lot of feedback on your talks in any case, but other people’s slides might be helpful to you as you are setting up your talk. As with posters, feel free to go with your own style as long as it is polished and clear.
